# quik-coding-task

## Task Description
The goal is to write a JSON API in Golang to get the balance and manage credit/debit  operations on the players wallets. For example, you might receive calls on your API to get  the balance of the wallet with id 123, or to credit the wallet with id 456 by 10.00 â‚¬. The  storage mechanism to use will be MySQL.
